There are many kinds of DRAM memories, and new kinds appear on the market with regularity as manufacturers attempt to keep up with rapidly increasing pro- cessor speeds. Each is based on the conventional DRAM cell, with optimizations that improve the speed with which the basic DRAM cells can be accessed.

* Fast page mode DRAM (FPM DRAM)
* Extended data out DRAM (EDO DRAM)
* Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
* Double Data-Rate Synchronous DRAM (DDR SDRAM)
* Video RAM (VRAM)
