 DRAM stores each bit as charge on a capacitor. DRAM storage can be made very denseâ€”each cell consists of a capacitor and a single access transistor. Unlike SRAM,   However, a DRAM memory cell is very sensitive to any disturbance. When the  capacitor voltage is disturbed, it will never recover. Exposure to light rays will  cause the capacitor voltages to change. In fact, the sensors in digital cameras and   camcorders are essentially arrays of DRAM cells.
