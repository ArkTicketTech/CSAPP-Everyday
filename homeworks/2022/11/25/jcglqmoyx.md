*Disks* are workhorse storage devices that hold enormous amounts of data, on the order of hundreds to thousands of gigabytes, as opposed to the hundreds or thousands of megabytes in a RAM-based memory. However, it takes on the order of milliseconds to read information from a disk, a hundred thousand times longer than from DRAM and a million times longer than from SRAM. Disks are constructed from *platters*. Each platter consists of two sides, or *surfaces*, that are coated with magnetic recording material. A disk consists of one or more platters stacked on top of each other and encased in a sealed package The entire assembly is often referred to as a *disk drive*, although we will usually refer to it as simply a *disk*. We will sometimes refer to disks as *rotating disks* to distinguish them from flash-based solid state disks (SSDs), which have no moving parts. Disk manufacturers describe the geometry of multiple-platter drives in terms of *cylinders*, where a cylinder is the collection of tracks on all the surfaces that are equidistant from the center of the spindle. E.g., if a drive has three platters and six surfaces, and the tracks on each surface are numbered consistently, then cylinder k is the collection of the six instances of track k.
