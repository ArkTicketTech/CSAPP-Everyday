The maximum number of bits that can be recorded by a disk is known as its *max- imum capacity*, or simply *capacity*. Disk capacity is determined by the following technology factors:

* *Recording density* (bits/in). The number of bits that can be squeezed into a 1- inch segment of a track.

* *Track density* (tracks/in). The number of tracks that can be squeezed into a 1-inch segment of the radius extending from the center of the platter.

* *Areal density* (bits/in2). The product of the recording density and the track density.
