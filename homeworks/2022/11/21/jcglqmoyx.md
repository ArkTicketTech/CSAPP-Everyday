DRAMs and SRAMs are *volatile* in the sense that they lose their information if the supply voltage is turned off. *Nonvolatile memories*, on the other hand, retain their information even when they are powered off. A *programmable ROM (PROM)* can be programmed exactly once. PROMs include a sort of fuse with each memory cell that can be blown once by zapping it with a high current. An *erasable programmable ROM (EPROM)* has a transparent quartz window that permits light to reach the storage cells. The EPROM cells are cleared to zeros by shining ultraviolet light through the window. Flash memory is a type of nonvolatile memory, based on EEPROMs, that has become an important storage technology. Flash memories are everywhere, providing fast and durable nonvolatile storage for a slew of electronic devices, including digital cameras, cell phones, and music players, as well as laptop, desktop, and server computer systems. Programs stored in ROM devices are often referred to as *firmware*. When a computer system is powered up, it runs firmware stored in a ROM.
