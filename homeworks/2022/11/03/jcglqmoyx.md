 Modern processors work well ahead of the currently executing instructions, reading new instructions from memory and decoding them to determine what operations to perform on what operands. This instruction pipelining works well as long as the instructions follow in a simple sequence.When a branch is encountered, the processor must guess which way the branch will go. For the case of a conditional jump, this means predicting whether or not the branch will be taken. For an instruction such as an indirect jump or a procedure return, this means predicting the target address.In a processor that employs speculative execution, the processor begins executing the instructions at the predicted branch target. It does this in a way that avoids modifying any actual register or memory locations until the actual outcome has been determined. If the prediction is correct, the processor can then “commit” the results of the speculatively executed instructions by storing them in registers or memory. If the prediction is incorrect, the processor must discard all of the speculatively executed results and restart the instruction fetch process at the correct location. The misprediction penalty is incurred in doing this, because the instruction pipeline must be refilled before useful results are generated.
