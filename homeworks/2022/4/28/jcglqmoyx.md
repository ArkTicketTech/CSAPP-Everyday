## hardware organization of a system

* buses: buses are electrical conduits the carry bytes of information back and forth between different components of a
  computer.
* I/O Devices: I/O devices are the system's connection to the external world. There are several kinds of I/O devices
  like a keyboard, a mouce, a monitor, a printer, etc.
* main memory: the main memory is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while
  the processor is executing the program.
* processor: The central processing unit (CPU), or simply processor, is the engine that interprets (or executes)
  instructions stored in main memory.

## Caches matter

A running computer system usually spends a lot of time moving information from one place to another. Caches serve
as temporary staging areas for information that the processor is likely to need in the near future.
