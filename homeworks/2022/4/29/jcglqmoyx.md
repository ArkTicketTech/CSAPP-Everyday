# two primary purpose of the operating system

* to protect the hardware from misuse by runaway applications.
* to provide applications with simple and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different
  low-level hardware devices.

## The operating system achieves both goals via: processes, virtual memory, and files.

* A process is the operating systemâ€™s abstraction for a running program.
* Virtual memory is an abstraction that provides each process with the illusion that it has exclusive use of the main
  memory.
* A file is a sequence of bytes, nothing more and nothing less. Every I/O device, including disks, keyboards, displays,
  and even networks, is modeled as a file.

Also, a computer system can communicate with other computer systems via network. In this case, these remote computer
systems can also be regarded as files.
