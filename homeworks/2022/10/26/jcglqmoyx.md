 A pipelined function unit is implemented as a series of stages, each of which performs part of the operation. For example, a typical floatingpoint adder contains three stages (and hence the three-cycle latency): one to process the exponent values, one to add the fractions, and one to round the result.  The arithmetic operations can proceed through the stages in close succession rather than waiting for one operation to complete before the next begins. This capability can be exploited only if there are successive, logically independent operations to be performed. Functional units with issue times of 1 cycle are said to be fully pipelined: they can start a new operation every clock cycle. Operations with capacity greater than 1 arise due to the capabilities of the multiple functional units, as was described earlier for the reference machine.
