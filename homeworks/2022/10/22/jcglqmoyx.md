 Within the ICU, the retirement unit keeps track of the ongoing processing and makes sure that it obeys the sequential semantics of the machine-level program.  Our figure shows a register file containing the integer, floating-point, and, more recently, SSE and AVX registers as part of the retirement unit, because this unit controls the updating of these registers. As an instruction is decoded, information about it is placed into a first-in, first-out queue. This information remains in the queue until one of two outcomes occurs. First, once the operations for the instruction have completed and any branch points leading to this instruction are confirmed as having been correctly predicted, the instruction can be retired, with any updates to the program registers being made. If some branch point leading    to this instruction was mispredicted, on the other hand, the instruction will be  flushed, discarding any results that may have been computed. By this means,  mispredictions will not alter the program state.
