A Universal Serial Bus (USB) controller is a conduit for devices attached to a USB bus, which is a wildly popular standard for connecting a variety of peripheral I/O devices, including keyboards, mice, modems, digital cameras, game controllers, printers, external disk drives, and solid state disks.

A graphics card (or adapter) contains hardware and software logic that is re- sponsible for painting the pixels on the display monitor on behalf of the CPU.

A host bus adapter that connects one or more disks to the I/O bus using a communication protocol defined by a particular host bus interface. The two most popular such interfaces for disks are SCSI and SATA. SCSI disks are typically faster and more expensive than SATA drives. A SCSI host bus adapter (often called a SCSI controller) can support multiple disk drives, as opposed to SATA adapters, which can only support one drive.
