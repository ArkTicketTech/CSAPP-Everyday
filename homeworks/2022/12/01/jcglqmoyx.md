- The time to access the 512 bytes in a disk sector is dominated by the seek time and the rotational latency. Accessing the first byte in the sector takes a long time, but the remaining bytes are essentially free.
- Since the seek time and rotational latency are roughly the same, twice the seek time is a simple and reasonable rule for estimating disk access time.
- The access time for a 64-bit word stored in SRAM is roughly 4 ns, and 60 ns for DRAM. Thus, the time to read a 512-byte sector-size block from memory is roughly 256 ns for SRAM and 4,000 ns for DRAM. The disk access time, roughly 10 ms, is about 40,000 times greater than SRAM, and about 2,500 times greater than DRAM.
