Different storage technologies have different price and performance trade-offs. SRAM is somewhat faster than DRAM, and DRAM is much faster than disk. On the other hand, fast storage is always more expensive than slower storage. SRAM costs more per byte than DRAM. DRAM costs much more than disk. SSDs split the difference between DRAM and rotating disk.
The price and performance properties of different storage technologies are changing at dramatically different rates. Since 1985, both the cost and performance of SRAM technology have im- proved at roughly the same rate. Access times and cost per megabyte have de- creased by a factor of about 100. However, the trends for DRAM and disk are much more dramatic and divergent. *DRAM and disk performance are lagging behind CPU performance.*
