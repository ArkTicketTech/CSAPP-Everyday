## Dynamic Memory Allocation: Advanced Concepts



### Freeing With Explicit Free Lists

- Insertion policy: where in the free list do you put a newly freed block?

- LIFO (last-in-first-out) policy

  - insert freed block at the beginning of the free list
  - Pro: simple and constant time
  - Con: studies suggest fragmentation is worse than address ordered

- Address-ordered policy

  - Insert freed block so that free list blocks are always in address order:

    $add_{prev} < add{cur} < add{next}$

  - Con : requires search

  - Pro: studies suggest fragmentation is lower than LIFO



### C Pointer Declarations: Test

```c
int *p;					//pointer of int
int *p[13];				//a array[13] of pointer of int
int *p(p[13]);			//the same
int **p;				//pointer of (pointer of int)
int (*p)[13];			//pointer of a array[13]
int *f();				//function returning a pointer of int
int (*f)();				//a pointer to a function returning int
int (*(*f())[13])();	/*function returning pointer to an array[13] of poninter to
						functions returning int */
int (*(*x[3])())[5];	/*an array[3] of pointer to (functions returning pointer
						to array[5] of ints) */
```
