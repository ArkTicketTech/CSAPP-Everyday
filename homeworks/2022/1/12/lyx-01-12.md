Structs

- Represented as block of memory 

- ```c
  struct rec {
      int a[4];
      size_t i;
      struct rec *next;
  }
  ```

- Fields are ordered according to declaration

- Alignment:

  - Within struct: Each element has alignment requirement K, where K is the size of this element [![img](https://github.com/JonnyKong/CMU-15-213-Intro-to-Computer-Systems/raw/master/Note_Images/alignment.png)](https://github.com/JonnyKong/CMU-15-213-Intro-to-Computer-Systems/blob/master/Note_Images/alignment.png)
  - Overall: Each struct has alignment requirement K, where K is the largest alignment of any element in struct [![img](https://github.com/JonnyKong/CMU-15-213-Intro-to-Computer-Systems/raw/master/Note_Images/alignment_overall.png)](https://github.com/JonnyKong/CMU-15-213-Intro-to-Computer-Systems/blob/master/Note_Images/alignment_overall.png)
  - To save space, put large data types first
