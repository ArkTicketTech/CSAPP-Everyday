## Exceptional Control Flow: Signals and Nonlocal Jumps

### Signals

- A signal is a small message that notifies a process that an event of some type has occurred in the system

  - Akin to exceptions and interrupts

  - Sent from the kernel (sometimes at the request of another process) to a process

  - Signal type is identified by small integer ID's (1 - 30)

  - Only information in a signal is its ID and the fact that it arrived

    | ID   | Name    | Default Action | Corresponding Event                     |
    | ---- | ------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | 2    | SIGINT  | Terminate      | User typed ctrl-c                       |
    | 9    | SIGKILL | Terminate      | Kill program(cannot override or ignore) |
    | 11   | SIGSEGV | Terminate      | Segmentation violation                  |
    | 14   | SIGALRM | Terminate      | Timer signal                            |
    | 17   | SIGCHLD | Ignore         | Child stopped or terminated             |

  

#### Sending Signals with /bin/kill Program

- /bin/kill program sends arbitrary to a process or process group
- Examples
  - /bin/kill -9 24818
    - Send SIGKILL to process 24818
  - /bin/kill -9 -24817
    - Send SIGKILL to every process in process group 24817
