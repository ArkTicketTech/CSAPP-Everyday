### Core i7 Page Table Translation

- The page table entry in the level 1, the page table points to the it gives the physical address of the level 2 page table and then the VPN bits in the virtual address are used to compute an offset into that and so  on
- The intel architecture says that it's the high-order bit of that 48 bit address is 0 then all the remaining bits have to be 0, and if the high order bit and the 48 bit address is 1, Then you extend the 1 all the way up to the remaining high order bits.
