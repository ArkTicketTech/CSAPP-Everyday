## Exceptional Control Flow Exceeded

### Exceptional Control Flow

### Synchronous Exceptions

### Processes

- **Definition**: A process is an instance of a running program

- Process provides each program with two key abstractions

#### Concurrent Processes

- Each process is a logical control flow.
- Two processes run concurrently(are concurrent) if their flows overlap in time
- Otherwise, they are sequential
- Examples(running on single core)

### Summary

- **Exceptions**
  - Events that require nonstandard control flow
  - Generated externally (interrupts) or internally (traps and faults)
- **Processes**
  - At any given time, system has multiple active processes
  - Only one can execute at a time on a single core, though
  - Each process appears to have total control of processor + private memory space
