Understanding pointers

* Every pointer has an associated type.
* Every pointer has a value.
* Pointers are created with the ‘&’ operator.
* Pointers are dereferenced with the ‘*’ operator.
* Arrays and pointers are closely related.
* Casting from one type of pointer to another changes its type but not its value.
* Pointers can also point to functions.
