 The techniques we have outlinedâ€”randomization, stack protection, and limiting which portions of memory can hold executable code are three of the most common mechanisms used to minimize the vulnerability of programs to buffer overflow attacks. They all have the properties that they require no special effort on the part of the programmer and incur very little or no performance penalty.  Each separately reduces the level of vulnerability, and in combination they become even more effective. Unfortunately, there are still ways to attack computers, and so worms and viruses continue to compromise the integrity of many machines.
