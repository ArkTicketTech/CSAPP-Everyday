# Several features about machine code and its disassembled representation are worth noting

* x86-64 instructions can range in length from 1 to 15 bytes. The instruction encoding is designed so that commonly used
  instructions and those with fewer operands require a smaller number of bytes than do less common ones or ones with
  more operands.
* The instruction format is designed in such a way that from a given starting position, there is a unique decoding of
  the bytes into machine instructions. For example, only the instruction pushq %rbx can start with byte value 53.
* The disassembler determines the assembly code based purely on the byte sequences in the machine-code file. It does not
  require access to the source or assembly-code versions of the program.
* The disassembler uses a slightly different naming convention for the instructions than does the assembly code
  generated by gcc. In our example, it has omitted the suffix ‘q’ from many of the instructions. These suffixes are size
  designators and can be omitted in most cases. Conversely, the disassembler adds the suffix ‘q’ to the call and ret
  instructions. Again, these suffixes can safely be omitted.
