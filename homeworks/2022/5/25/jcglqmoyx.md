Passing control from function P to function Q involves simply setting the program counter (PC) to the starting address
of the code for Q. However, when it later comes time for Q to return, the processor must have some record of the code
location where it should resume the execution of P. This information is recorded in x86-64 machines by invoking
procedure Q with the instruction call Q. This instruction pushes an address A onto the stack and sets the PC to the
beginning of Q. The pushed address A is referred to as the return address and is computed as the address of the
instruction immediately following the call instruction. The counterpart instruction ret pops an address A off the stack
and sets the PC to A. The general forms of the call and ret instructions are described as follows:

```
Instruction Description
call Label Procedure call
call * Operand Procedure call
ret Return from call
```

(These instructions are referred to as callq and retq in the disassembly outputs generated by the program objdump. The
added suffix ‘q’ simply emphasizes that these are x86-64 versions of call and return instructions, not IA32. In x86-64
assembly code, both versions can be used interchangeably.)
