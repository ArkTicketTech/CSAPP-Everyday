	  > Since 1985, both the cost and performance of SRAM technology have im- proved at roughly the same rate.  

	-  
	  > While the cost per megabyte of DRAM has decreased by a factor of 44,000 (more than four orders of magnitude!), DRAM access times have decreased by only a factor of 10 (Figure 6.15(b)).  

	- 对于DRAM和磁盘来说，降低成本（增加集成度）比降低访问时间容易很多。  
	-  
	  > DRAM and disk performance are lagging behind CPU performance.

	- 现代计算机大量使用SRAM作为缓存，尽可能弥补处理器和主存之间的性能差异。
