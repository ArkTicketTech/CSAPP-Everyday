- ### Word Selection in Direct-Mapped Caches  
	- 最后一步是找到偏移位置  
- ### Line Replacement on Misses in Direct-Mapped Caches  
	- miss发生时 需要从下一层获取block并存储在当前层 如果当前层满，则需要替换一个 cache line  
- ### Putting It Together: A Direct-Mapped Cache in Action  
	-  
	  > The mechanisms that a cache uses to select sets and identify lines are extremely simple. They have to be, because the hardware must perform them in a few nanoseconds.  

	- 下面是一个具体的例子  
		- (S, E, B, m) = (4, 1, 2, 4)  
		-  
		  > In other words, the cache has four sets, one line per set, 2 bytes per block, and 4- bit addresses. We will also assume that each word is a single byte.  

		- 以下有一些关于地址的组成有趣的事实：  
			-  
			  > The concatenation of the tag and index bits uniquely identifies each block in memory. For example, block 0 consists of addresses 0 and 1, block 1 consists of addresses 2 and 3, block 2 consists of addresses 4 and 5, and so on.  

			-  
			  > Since there are eight memory blocks but only four cache sets, multiple blocks map to the same cache set (i.e., they have the same set index). For example, blocks 0 and 4 both map to set 0, blocks 1 and 5 both map to set 1, and so on.  

			-  
			  > Blocks that map to the same cache set are uniquely identified by the tag. For example, block 0 has a tag bit of 0 while block 4 has a tag bit of 1, block 1 has a tag bit of 0 while block 5 has a tag bit of 1, and so on.
